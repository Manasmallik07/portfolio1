                <h2>Real-Time Chat Application</h2>
                <p>I developed a real-time chat application that facilitates dynamic messaging and upvoting features, providing users with an engaging and interactive experience. This project demonstrates my ability to create efficient communication protocols and user-friendly interfaces, while leveraging modern web technologies for enhanced performance and maintainability.</p>
                    <h2>Key Features Dynamic Messaging:</h2> Users can send and receive messages in real time, ensuring seamless communication. The application employs WebSockets for immediate updates without the need for page refreshes.<br>
                    <h2>Upvoting System:</h2>Users can upvote messages, allowing the community to highlight the most valuable contributions. This feature enhances user interaction and engagement within the chat environment.
                    <h2>Structured Messaging Protocols:</h2>I developed organized messaging protocols that optimize client-server communication, ensuring messages are efficiently transmitted and processed.
                    <h2>User-Friendly Interface:</h2> The application features an intuitive design crafted with HTML and CSS, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the chat functionalities.
                    <h2>Type Safety with TypeScript:</h2>I implemented TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability. This decision not only enhanced the development process but also minimized runtime errors.
                    <h2>In-Memory Data Management:</h2>The chat application utilizes an in-memory store for chat data, significantly improving performance by reducing the latency typically associated with data retrieval and manipulation.</p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
                    Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript
                    Technologies: WebSockets, HTML, CSS
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Development Process</h2>
                    Planning and Design: Started with wireframing the user interface to ensure a clear and intuitive layout.
                    Implementation of WebSockets: Set up a WebSocket server to handle real-time communication, enabling instant message delivery between clients.
                    Creating Messaging Protocols: Designed structured protocols for message formatting and handling, optimizing data flow between clients and the server.
                    Frontend Development: Developed the user interface using HTML and CSS, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.
                    TypeScript Integration: Integrated TypeScript into the project for better code organization and type safety, which facilitated easier debugging and maintenance.
                    Performance Optimization: Managed an in-memory store to handle chat data, leading to faster access and improved application performance.
